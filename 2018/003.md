# Shell ... and Linux?
## softlink, hardlink and inode (Linux Filesystem and `ln` related)

## Invoking Shells (and polluting variables)
Pay attention to how you run shell

`$ ksh # start a new shell, when you exit it go back to previous one`

`$ exec ksh # terminate current one, start AND REPLACE with this new one`

## Invoking Scripts
Quite similar to invoking shells

`$ sh ./billy.sh # start a new shell, go back to previous one when exit`

`exec ./billy.sh # end current one, start and replace with new one`

Something new?? `source`

`. ./billy.sh`

`source ./billy.sh # same as above, I prefer using this when learning`

`source` make current shell to read and execute that file, and apply its change to current shell -- useful to update current environment

Also return exit status of last command in that file.

In this example, `billy.sh` needs to be readable.
