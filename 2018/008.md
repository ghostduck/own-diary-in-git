# SSH Tunneling
`ssh -L`

Set a local port in your current machine to somewhere else.

# cronjob and cron tab, allowlist
`/etc/cron.allow` and `/etc/cron.deny` only controls who can run `crontab`.  

If a job is already added to crontab for unknown reason, even if they are in `etc/cron.deny`, the job will still run.

# Bash
## Helps debugging 

```
# debug mode
exec 5> command.txt
BASH_XTRACEFD="5"
set -x
# end debug mode with set +x
```

It will keeps recording commands you run in script to `command.txt`, until it sees `set +x`.

## Syntax
```
if test $? -ne 0 ; then
...
fi
```

EZ?

```
if [ $? - ne 0 ] then
...
fi 
```
OMFG, don't miss that `;`

## Misc
`$()` reads output from stdin then assign it to a variable, so don't use `grep -q` in `$()`
