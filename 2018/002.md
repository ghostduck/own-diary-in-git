# What have I learnt?
## Bootstrap

### Bootstrap Gridsystem

Reference: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/

Divide into 12 pieces, use class name to control width

## Event handling in JS

### Prevent onClick propagating

**Scenario:** A checkbox inside table row. Row has an onClick event. Click on checkbox will also triggers row's onClick event. I don't want that.

**Solution:** checkbox's onClick event should include `event.stopPropagation()`.

Note that adding `stopPropagation()` in checkbox's `onChange` won't stop the propagation of `onClick` to parent class (row in this case).

This seems obvious ... but I failed that actually LUL

## Rant
### React
No warning / error message when passing props that are undefined at all.
```
<CustomComponent
  someprop={this.undefinedthingbytypo}
/>
```
Don't know why linter won't give me any error messages at all if those props are `"this."something` ... linter just shows `any`
